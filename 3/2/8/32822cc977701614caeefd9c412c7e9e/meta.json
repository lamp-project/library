Instead, Brian spends his days working at the head office of a multinational company. He's a working zombie. Life isn't easy for Brian. Most humans just aren't comfortable with the idea of working beside the undead. How would you feel if you had to share an office, a kitchen or a washroom with an undead creature? Read as Brian tries to live a normal life and have a successful career while keeping his true nature a secret from his workmates.","epub":"https://english-e-reader.net/download?link=brians-brains-hugh-mortimer&format=epub","slug":"brians-brains-hugh-mortimer"}
