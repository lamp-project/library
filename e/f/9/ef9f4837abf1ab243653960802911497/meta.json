{"title":"The Absence of Emily","cover":"https://english-e-reader.net/covers/The_Absence_of_Emily-Jack_Ritchie.jpg","author":"Jack Ritchie","level":"B2 Intermediate+","desc":"When I married my second wife Emily, I moved to her house in Northern California. It is a big house with a lot of land around it. It is outside a small town. The next house is almost exactly the same. It belongs to Emily's sister Millicent. Millicent and Emily. The sisters. But their appearances and character are completely different. Millicent is tall and rather thin. She is very strong-minded and likes to control everyone around her, including Emily. She wasn't too pleased when I came and took Emily away from her influence. But at that time I already knew how to solve the problem. In spite of her difficult nature Millicent is still one of the closest people to my Emily. So it's necessary for me to get along with her. That is what I have decided. Unfortunately a third person comes into action and ruins my plans.","epub":"https://english-e-reader.net/download?link=the-absence-of-emily-jack-ritchie&format=epub","slug":"the-absence-of-emily-jack-ritchie"}
