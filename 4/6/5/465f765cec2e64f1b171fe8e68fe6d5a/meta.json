{"title":"Martin Luther King","cover":"https://english-e-reader.net/covers/Martin_Luther_King-Alan_C_Mclean.jpg","author":"Alan C. Mclean","level":"B1 Pre-Intermediate","desc":"Martin Luther King is known worldwide as an uncompromising fighter for human rights. He was the first African-American politician of such magnitude. He was a religious preacher, as well as a real romantic and a dreamer until the last day of his life. At the age of fifteen, Martin got a convincing victory in the competition of speakers. Young Martin studied in Boston and received a PHD in theology. In the fifties he joined a large organization that was engaged in protecting the rights of citizens. Martin Luther King headed it for the rest of his life. This man never resorted to violence: he protested exclusively peacefully. There was not a single case where followers of Luther King were observed in the riots. Like their leader, the followers were humanists.","epub":"https://english-e-reader.net/download?link=martin-luther-king-alan-c-mclean&format=epub","slug":"martin-luther-king-alan-c-mclean"}
