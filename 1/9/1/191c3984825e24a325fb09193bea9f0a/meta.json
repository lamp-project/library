Their job is to write an aricle about the motorcycle race. They use different drugs during the journey. That is why they both think chaos is going on around. Flocks of bats are chasing them. Vile creatures are at every step. Only a special medicine can save them. These two men do bad things: they threaten the maid, smash cars and run from the police. Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish reality from hallucinations.","epub":"https://english-e-reader.net/download?link=fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas-hunter-s-thompson&format=epub","slug":"fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas-hunter-s-thompson"}
