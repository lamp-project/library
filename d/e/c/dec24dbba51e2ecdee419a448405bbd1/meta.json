They knew everything about each other or at least wanted to know. An ordinary man lived in this town with his old and sick mother. It's a common situation when a child helps his parent in old age. Everybody understood why he could not take part in life. His mother constantly needed help. The good son always went home after work. He couldn't afford himself even business trips for improving his career. He hadn't any close friends or a girlfriend. His whole life was around the sick mother and he hardly ever had some free time.

The postman told the owner he had seen fire and tried to prevent it.","epub":"https://english-e-reader.net/download?link=how-is-your-mother-simon-brett&format=epub","slug":"how-is-your-mother-simon-brett"}
