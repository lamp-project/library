For some people, the simplest actions could turn into a real obsession, and Mrs. Foster was one of those people. The woman left the house half an hour earlier than needed to go the train station.

But for Mr. Foster, his wife's behavior was annoying and he could not understand her.","epub":"https://english-e-reader.net/download?link=the-way-up-to-heaven-roald-dahl&format=epub","slug":"the-way-up-to-heaven-roald-dahl"}
